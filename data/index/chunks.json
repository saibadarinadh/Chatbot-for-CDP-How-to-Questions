Segment simplifies the process of collecting data and connecting new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it. You can use Segment to track events that happen when a user interacts with the interfaces. “Interfaces” is Segment’s generic word for any digital properties you own: your website, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.\nWhen you capture interaction data in Segment, you can send it (often in real-time) to your marketing, product, and analytics tools, as well as to data warehouses.

Do it once.\nSegment eliminates this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to Segment, and Segment understands how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination.

In more complicated implementations, Segment can serve as a wrapper to trigger messages directly to other APIs, and can inspect, correct, classify and block the message contents.",

    "chunk_text": "## Types of Segment messages\nSegment’s libraries generate and send messages to our tracking API in JSON format, and provide a standard structure for the basic API calls. We also provide recommended JSON structure (also known as a schema, or ‘Spec’) that helps keep the most important parts of your data consistent, while allowing great flexibility in what other information you collect and where.\nThere are six calls in the basic tracking API, which answer specific questions:\n- Identify: Who is the user?\n- Track: What are they doing?\n- Page: What web page are they on?\n- Screen: What app screen are they on?\n- Group: What account or organization are they part of?\n- Alias: What was their past identity?\nAmong these calls, you can think of Identify, Group, and Alias as similar types of calls, all to do with updating our understanding of the user who is triggering Segment messages. You can think of these calls as adding information to, or updating an object record in a database.Objectsare described using “traits”, which you can collect as part of your calls.\nThe other three, Track, Page, and Screen, can be considered as increasingly specific types of events.Eventscan occur multiple times, but generate separate records which append to a list, instead of being updated over time.\nA Track call is the most basic type of call, and can represent any type of event. Page and Screen are similar and are triggered by a user viewing a page or screen, however Page calls can come from both web and mobile-web views, while Screen callsonlyoccur on mobile devices. Because of the difference in platform, the context information collected is very different between the two types of calls.\nTip! Segment recommends that you always use the Page and Screen calls when recording a page-view, rather than creating a “Page Viewed” event, because the Page/Screen calls automatically collect much better context information.",

These are recommendations only, but by collecting all of the information in these blocks, you can ensure that common tools used in that use-case have the information they need to function.\nA third section of the Spec is the “industry specs” which provide recommendations that include an explicit translation or mapping in the Segment servers, to best power the downstream Destinations commonly used in these industries.",

Translation is done on the Segment servers, keeping your page size, method count, and load time small.Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS) customers can encrypt data flowing into their destinationsHLS customers with a HIPAA eligible workspace can encrypt data in fields marked as Yellow in the Privacy Portal before they flow into an event stream, cloud-mode destination.To learn more about data encryption, see theHIPAA Eligible Segment documentation\nCloud-mode: The sources send data directly to the Segment servers, which then translate it for each connected downstream destination, and send it on.

Regardless of if you’re a new company just implementing analytics for the first time, or a multi–national corporation modernizing your analytics stack, it’s a great idea tostart with a Tracking Plan. For new implementations, this can be as simple as a document where you write down these four things for each item you track:\n- What am I tracking? (What is the event name or type?)\n- Why am I tracking it? (What questions does this data answer?)\n- For whom am I tracking it? (Who owns this question, tool, or business area?)\n- Where (which destination tools) do I want to send this data to?\nIf you’re a large or long-established organization and you’re replacing existing tools, you’ll want to spend more time on this to maintain analytic parity and continuity of tooling. We highly recommendreading up on tracking plansandschemasforProtocols, our tool for managing and sharing tracking plans and enforcing schemas.\nRegardless of your organization’s size or age, you’ll want to take an inventory of the destination tools you’ll be using with Segment, and make a list of the connection modes each one accepts.

For example, if you include the following three parameters in your URL:?utm_source=mysource&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=mytestcampaign, once a visitor arrives using a link containing the above, Segment automatically grabs the UTM parameters and subsequent events will contain these parameters within the ‘context’ object (visible in the raw view of your Source Debugger.)",

He navigates around and bookmarks an internal page - or maybe shares a link with a friend, who shares it with another friend. All those links would then point back to the same test utm_source as the initial referrer for any purchase.\nSegment doesn’t validate UTM parameter names. This design supports the flexibility to track both standard parameters (for example, utm_source, utm_medium) and custom parameters defined by users. As a result, all parameters present in the URL collected as is, and are added to the context field without checks for naming conventions or validity.\nIf you want to ensure that only standard UTM parameters (such as, utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term) are included in the context.campaign object, you can implementSource middlewarein your Analytics.js setup.\nFor example:",

Your users have control over what gets loaded on their pages and can use plugins or browser settings to block third-party scripts, including Segment.

However, it’s important to note that Segment cannot guarantee their effectiveness.\n- Use thebundle obfuscationfeature.

Segment then translates the content of those messages into different formats for use by other tools (which Segment callsDestinations), and sends the translated messages to those tools. The Segment servers also archive a copy of the data, and cansend data to your storage systems(such as databases, warehouses, or bulk-storage buckets).",

Segment recommends it as the default installation for any website.\n- The Segment Mobile SDKsare the best way to simplify tracking in your iOS, Android, and Xamarin apps. Segment recommends them over server-side sources as the default installation for any mobile app.\n- Server-side sourceslet you send analytics data directly from your servers when client-side tracking doesn’t work, or when you’re sending mission-critical data like revenues.",

    "chunk_text": "## How you can track data\nSegment supports several ways to implement tracking. The two most common are to usedevice-basedorserver-basedlibraries. You can use Segment’s device-based libraries, such as JavaScript, iOS, and Android, to make calls on users’ browsers or mobile devices. You can also track data with Segment’s server-based libraries, such as Node, Python, or PHP, where the calls are triggered on your own servers and then sent to the Segment servers.\nWhen you collect data using device-based libraries, you can choose between these two different connection modes:\n- Cloud-modeis where the library sends the data directly to the Segment servers which then translate and forward it.\n- Device-modeis where the library sends the data both directly to the Segment servers, and also to the servers for the destination tool. Device-mode sometimes requires someadditional set-up steps, but can unlock rich device data.\nAlthough there are some tradeoffs between the two approaches, neither is better than the other, and Segment recommends that you implement a mix of both. In general, more direct interaction data is available using a device-based library, but server-based collection is more secure, reliable, and can’t be blocked by ad blockers.",

The four most important methods are:\n- Identify: Who is the user?\n- PageandScreen: What web page or app screen are they on?\n- Track: What are they doing?\nEvery call shares the samecommon fields. When you use these methodsas intended, it allows Segment to detect a specific type of data and correctly translate it to send it on to downstream destinations.",

Once the snippet is running on your site, you can turn on destinations from the destinations page in your workspace and they start loading on your site automatically.\nNote that you should remove other native third-party destination code that you might have on your site. For example, if you’re using Segment to send data to Google Analytics, make sure you remove the Google Analytics snippet from your site source code to prevent sending the data twice.\nIf you only want the most basic Google Analytics setup, there’s no need to continue with the setup. Just toggle on Google Analytics in the Segment interface.\nA lot of analytics and marketing tools need to record who each user is on your site.

Creating one source per data type provides the following benefits:\n- Debugger ease of use - mixing libraries/sources on a single API key means you’re heavily reliant on filtering to actually test events\n- Flexibility sending data to different projects - if you want to have different warehouse schemas, analytics projects, etc, having multiple sources would create this separation\n- More control - as your account grows with the number of destinations you enable, having separate sources allows you to have more control\n- A source type cannot be changed after it is created. You must create a new source if you would like to use a different source type.",

    "chunk_text": "## Library tiers\nSegment has defined three tiers for libraries: Flagship, Maintenance, and Community. These tiers indicate the level of support, enhancements, and maintenance each library receives from Segment.\nThe criteria for assigning a library to a tier include its overall usage by customers and the availability of newer versions. Here’s how Segment defines each tier:\n- Flagshiplibraries offer the most up-to-date functionality on Segment’s most popular platforms. Segment actively maintains Flagship libraries, which benefit from new feature releases and ongoing development and support.\n- Maintenancelibraries send data as intended but receive no new feature support and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. When possible, Segment recommends using a Flagship version of these libraries.\n- Communitylibraries are neither managed nor updated by Segment. These libraries are available on GitHub under the MIT License for the open-source community to fork or contribute.\nIf a library falls into one of these tiers, you’ll see the tier label at the beginning of the library’s page.\nThis page was last modified: 18 Nov 2024",

For example, you might track users who viewed an advertisement in one app and installed another app as a result.\nHowever, some mobile attribution tools do more advanced reconciliation based on more than the native identifier, which requires the SDK on the device to work properly.

Here’s how Segment defines each tier:\n- Flagshiplibraries offer the most up-to-date functionality on Segment’s most popular platforms. Segment actively maintains Flagship libraries, which benefit from new feature releases and ongoing development and support.\n- Maintenancelibraries send data as intended but receive no new feature support and only critical maintenance updates from Segment. When possible, Segment recommends using a Flagship version of these libraries.\n- Communitylibraries are neither managed nor updated by Segment. These libraries are available on GitHub under the MIT License for the open-source community to fork or contribute.\nIf a library falls into one of these tiers, you’ll see the tier label at the beginning of the library’s page.\nThis page was last modified: 18 Nov 2024",

Do you want to acquire new customers, activate new signups, drive incremental revenues among your current customer base? You can best answer this question by interviewing stakeholders who would consume the data in your organization.\nWith your business goals documented, you now need to map user actions to those business goals. For example, if one of your goals is to activate new signups, you want to think about which activities are related to a signup. Ask yourself what actions people take before signing up. Do specific actions predict user signups?\nAs an example, you may end up with a list like the following:\n- Ad Campaign Clicked\n- Link Clicked\n- Article Completed\n- Campaign Opened\n- Form Initiated\n- Form Submitted\n- User Signed Up\nWhile these may only represent a portion of the total user actions you will track, focusing on business objectives helps make data collection more manageable.",

While some customers find success with the “less is more” philosophy of tracking data, others take a more liberal “track more and analyze later” approach. Both options have pros and cons you should take into account when you consider your company’s needs.\nRegardless of your approach, keep the following tips in mind:\n- Pick a casing convention.Segment recommendsTitle Casefor event names andsnake_casefor property names.

As you get more comfortable, you can add more events to your tracking plan that can answer peripheral questions.\nSegment began by tracking these events:\n- User Signed Up\n- Source Data Sent\n- Subscription Started\nNext, Segment added some of the following peripheral events that helped monitor performance:\n- User Invited;\n When users invite more people to their organization, it’s a good indicator that they’re engaged and serious about using the product. This helps measure organizational growth.\n- Destination Enabled;\n Turning on a destination is a key value driver for Segment’s customers.\n- Debugger Call Expanded;\n When Segment sees that a certain customer has used the live event stream feature a number of times, Segment can contact them to see if they need help debugging.\nFor an ecommerce company, however, the main events might be something like:\n- Account Created\n- Product Added\n- Order Completed\nNote that Segment has a set of “reserved” event names specifically for ecommerce, called the Segmentecommerce spec. Check it out to see which events Segments covers and how they are used in our downstream destinations.\nFor a community, on the other hand, an entirely different set of actions indicate engagement, listed in the following pyramid. For example, a community likeGrowthHackersmay want to track actions like:\n- Content Viewed\n- Content Shared\n- Comment Submitted\n- Content Produced\n- Content Curated\nWith this, they’re able to measure key metrics around engagement and understand how users are moving towards their ultimate conversion event: curation content for others.

As with event data, some user data, such as information about the devices they use, is captured automatically by mParticleâs native SDKs. Two important types of user data must be captured by writing code in your app:\n- User identitiesare unique identifiers for your user, like an email address or customer ID. These are different from the device identities collected automatically by the SDKs, which donât identify an individual person but a particular cell phone, browser session, or some other device.User identities help mParticle keep track of unique users of your app and allow you to track a userâs activity over time and across different devices. To learn a lot more about user and device identities, read ourIDSyncguide. For now, you just need to know that a user identity is a way of identifying aperson, independently of thedevicethey are currently using.\n- User Attributesare key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user. The value of a user attribute can be:A stringA numberA listA boolean value (trueorfalse)null- attributes with anullvalue function as âtagsâ, and can be used to sort your users into categories.\nUser Attributesare key-value pairs that can store any custom data about your user.

Inthe previous stepyou should have installed and initialized the mParticle SDK in at least one of your app platforms. This means youâre already set up to capture Session Start and Session End events, as well as basic data about the device. Grab a friendly developer again, if you need one, and try to add some additional user and event data to your implementation. Here are a few things you might try, with links to the appropriate developer docs:\n- Add a Customer ID or Email Address for a user.Android/iOS/Web\n- Create a custom user attribute that tells you something about a user. For example:status: \"premium\".Android/iOS/Web",

Some additional resources you might want to look at include:\n- One of the key benefits of mParticle is the power to collect data once and forward it to as many output services as you wish. Browse theIntegrationssection of our docs to learn more about the different services mParticle can forward your data to.\n- Most event outputs work by forwarding data server-side via the output partnerâs HTTP API. However, some outputs require extra client-side code to be added to your native app, to allow data to be sent directly from your app to the output service. These integrations are called âembedded kitsâ. You can read more about them in theiOSandAndroiddocumentation.\n- Sending web data to an output usually works a little differently from native. If youâre using mParticle on the web, read our guide toWorking with Web Data.\nNext up, you will learn about the second category of mParticle data bycreating an audience.\nWas this page helpful?",

Data points represent Events such as Custom Events or Screen Views, or User attributes such as Customer Id or Email.\nEach data point includes criteria used to select the data point from an incoming data stream, and a definition called a schema that validates the contents of the data point. You can view data points in all three Data Master tools: Catalog, Live Stream, and Data Plan.\nFor example, here is a view of the Play Video data point in Catalog:\nHere is a view of the a Commerce Event data point in Live Stream:\nThis view of a data point is from Data Plan:\nWas this page helpful?",

Our machine learning engine analyzes user behavior patterns to help you identify and reach users most likely to take desired actions.\nYou can define audiences using any user-associated data captured with mParticle, whether from platform inputs or partner feeds, and enhance them with predictive insights.\nWhen you fully instrument your app using the mParticle SDK, you send data from apps to the mParticle platform. This data feeds both traditional segmentation and our predictive models. You can also enrich that data stream with other sources like CRM data or purchase data from other channels. Comprehensive data capture improves both immediate segmentation and predictive accuracy.",

There are two approaches to accomplishing this using Audiences:\n- Rules-based:Taking this strategy, you would use audience criteria to build a customer segment that aligns with your target characteristics, like users who installed your app in the last 72 hours with fewer than three sessions.\n- AI-powered:Using a predictive approach, you could simply define your business goal, then let Predictive Attributes to perform a comprehensive analysis of user data to predict which new users are most likely to take the engagement action you have defined. Once the Predictive Attribute has been generated, you could use it as an audience criteria to select users who are statistically most likely to engage with your app.\nNo matter which approach you take, you can easily forward your audience to push notification and email partners.  Once these audience connections are established, mParticle instantiates a corresponding audiences both partners.  No coding is necessary.",

This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.\nThe report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.\nYou may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:\n- Did you enable/disable the service on the date in question?\n- Are you using data filters?\n- Is the message type not supported by the integration?\n- Have you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types?\n- Are you sendingcommerce eventsthat are expanded before being forwarded?",

This allows mParticle to implement server side data forwarding and supports our value proposition to customers of not requiring that additional app SDK components be continually added and updated for integrations.\nIn order to enable mParticleâs integration with Mixpanel, you will need an account with Mixpanel and have your Mixpanel Token for mParticle configuration. Your Mixpanel Token can be found at the Mixpanel topic,Find Project Token.",

IDSync gives you granular control over how user profiles are managed. To support IDSync, mParticle maintains a hierarchy of different ID types.\nA traditional Mixpanel implementation, using the Mixpanel SDK, manages sign-up funnels by using the following process:\n- When a user first downloads your app, theDistinct IDis set using adefault anonymous device id(Apple Advertising ID for iOS, a random GUID for Android, a Cookie ID for Web).",

For example, most partners have a method called or equivalent tologEvent.  When someone callsmParticle.logEvent, our kits map to the partner SDKlogEventmethod, in this case,Braze.logEvent, and automatically sends it to Braze. You donât have to callBraze.logEventbecause mParticle does it for you after you callmParticle.logEvent.",

This ensures that the custom attributes received by Braze are of the expected data type. This can impact segment building and triggering campaigns.  If incorrect data types are identified after data has been flowing, there can be extra work to true up the users with the legacy data type on those attributes.  To give Brazeâs type detection a better opportunity to evaluate data types properly, you can enable the following 2 Connection Settings:Enable API Custom Attribute Type DetectionandEnable Kit Custom Attribute Type Detection.",

After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.\nThere are several factors that can impact your match rate:\n- Data quality: more accurate, up-to-date, and complete user data leads to a higher match rate.\n- Privacy settings: Facebook users with stricter privacy or data sharing settings may also impact your match rate.\n- Identifiers used: certain identifiers, like email addresses and Facebook user IDs, have higher match rates due to their uniqueness.\n- Audience size: larger audiences have higher match rates because of the increased chance in finding matches within the set of Facebook users. Facebook suggests a minimum audience size of 1,000 people for best results.\nA higher match rate means that more of your user data was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, itâs important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.",

For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.\nBy default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if the value of their âvalue reprepresenting attributeâ is greater than 0.

If an audience is selected while in the processing state, and later is calculated to be less than 100 users, the campaign will not serve.\n- Maximum- There is a limit of 300 million users in an audience.  This is a count of the raw number of records that mParticle has sent to Pinterest.  If an audience reaches this limit, mParticle will no longer send user updates to Pinterest.\n- Additional Notes- If an email or device ID is added to an audience, and is not currently a Pinterest user, the user will not be added to the audience even if the user later becomes a Pinterest user.",

You can obtain credentials for your Workspace from the Workspace Settings screen. Note that this authentication is for a single workspace and scopes the DSR to this workspace only.\nTo view workspace credentials:\n- Click on the current workspace name in the upper left corner.\n- ClickSettings.\n- Click on the name of a workspace to display the Edit Workspace settings page.\nYou can authenticate in 2 ways:\n- Many HTTP clients support basic authentication out of the box. Use your API key for the âusernameâ and your API secret for âpasswordâ.\n- Manually set theauthenticationheader by encoding your key and secret together:2.1 Concatenate your application key and secret together with a colon (:) separating the two:example-api-key:example-api-secret2.2 Base64 with UTF-8 encode the result:ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==2.3 Prefix the encoded string with the authorization method,including a space:Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==2.4 Set resulting string as theAuthorizationheader in your HTTP requests:Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZS1hcGkta2V5OmV4YW1wbGUtYXBpLXNlY3JldA==\nManually set theauthenticationheader by encoding your key and secret together:",

Establishing and maintaining a well-defined identity resolution strategy is essential, but it can be overwhelming to get started. Several challenges may arise, such as limited and outdated customer data, data silos, technical difficulties, in-flexibility, consistency, compliance, and maintenance.\nLytics offers a solution that powers brands' identity resolution strategies by aggregating data from disparate sources, defining a standardized customer schema, unifying disparate sources, surfacing individual consumer profiles, enabling better understanding, segmentation, and activation across channel tools, ensuring control, visibility, flexibility, security, privacy, and compliance, and maximizing match rates and accuracy across activation channels.\nThe goal is to construct complex consumer profiles and maintain accurate and compliant user profiles as your brand evolves. Defining the relationship between consumer identifiers is a necessary first step in surfacing unified user profiles that enable your brand to create the best consumer engagements while meeting evolving compliance requirements.

This graph represents connections between pieces of data observed across multiple sources or even within a single source.\nTo create (or update) profiles from a data stream, the stream must contain one or moreidentity keysthat identify distinct users with which to associate the data.  When data is observed for a given identity key, it stores the relevant profile metadata in an object called anidentity fragment.  When there's evidence on a data stream  that two keys or fragments should be connected\nWhen evidence on a data stream shows that two keys or fragments identify the same real-world entity, those fragments become connected in the same identity graph.

  {
    "chunk_text": "## Graph Mechanics\nAs you learned from the identity resolution overview, a profile comprises one or more identity fragments.  Many profiles start as singletons – new data is observed on a data stream. That event's identifier keys create any necessary identity fragments and store the event's associated data on that fragment.\nHowever, we're not satisfied with several singletons – our objective is to stitch data sources together by linking the appropriate underlying fragments.  Stitching occurs when we observe two identifiers in a single event.  A common stitching event is a newsletter signup, where the email address from the newsletter form is linked to the cookie from their web activity and creates a link between activity from the browser on the device and any activity associated with the email address, which could eventually encompass purchases, support tickets, CRM data, etc.\nIn graph terms, stitching creates an edge between two nodes representing two identity fragments.  If we wanted to retrieve a profile associated with an email address, we would retrieve all of the fragments with edges or connections to other fragments.  From there, we'd want to find all of the connections to those other fragments, and so on, until there are no more connections to follow.  Following one fragment to another is calledtraversal.  The full set of fragments that are found to have connections to the initial fragment are calledneighbors.\nIn Lytics, default graph limits cap the number of traversals allowed for an individual profile at 50 and cap the number of neighbors allowed at 50.  Changing these values can create different sets of user profiles over the same data set and should not be adjusted lightly.  To change these values for your data, please contactLytics support.",

    "chunk_text": "## Identity Keys\nAs we traverse identity graphs, we'll quickly find that identity fragments and their corresponding identity keys are not all created equal. An identifier's strength must contribute proportionally to its influence on identity resolution.\nFor example, you have email addresses and cookies as identity keys.  Generally, a user identified with an email address can have multiple cookie values (from different devices, browsers, periods, etc.).  Imagine hosting a promotional, in-person event and having multiple tablets collecting participants' email addresses.  Depending on how those email addresses are collected (most likely through an online form), you'll likely have one cookie associated withmanyemail addresses.",

  {
    "chunk_text": "## Field Types\nField types for Identity Keys can be either a string or a string set.  String sets are a common field type for cookies since one profile is expected to have many cookie values over time.  Email addresses are not so cut-and-dry.  Some organizations will constrain profiles to have one email address, while others will allow profiles to have multiple (personal, work, etc.).  In our example of email collection via physical tablet, if the email address is a single-valued string type, we won't end up with an over-merged hairball.\nUsing an identity key that allows for a set of values is usually a good idea to have a sensical capacity cap on the field type.  A set of cookies, for example, might have a capacity limit of 50 values.  On the other hand, a set of emails might have a capacity limit of 5 values.",

In the event of a conflict in stitching and merging, higher-ranked identity keys will win.  Typically, most Lytics users configure email identifiers to be ranked higher than cookie identifiers.\nImagine a scenario where email A is connected to cookies X and Y, while email B is connected to cookie Z.  If new data is observed that connects email B with cookie Y, we have aconflict, meaning that a resulting stitching between the two fragments would yield a profile with twodifferentemail fragments and violates our merge rules.\nThe ranks of identity keys would dictate that, for the new event, the email address it contains is of a higher priority than the cookie value that it contains and would consequently update the profile for Email A andnotthe profile for Email B.",

That is, we need a way to ensure that a relatively greedy algorithm doesn't result in profiles becoming more fragile and susceptible to conflicts.\nIn Lytics, that is accomplished via graph compaction, a process by which data from multiple fragments is combined into a single fragment.  Doing so allows well-established relationships in the graph to be solidified while making room for new relationships within the profile.  It functions more as a type of profile housekeeping to keep profile fragments tidy.\nCompaction in identity graphs can take on a few forms.",

The point of identity resolution within a customer data platform is to enable long and rich relationships with customers.  The longer that Email A and Email B represent profiles in the platform, the more cookies with which they'll eventually become connected.  Each identity key's ranking allows an identity graph to compact by size or time.\n- Size compaction: Identity key sets can be compacted after they reach a configurable size.  If size compaction is enabled to compact a set after 30 values, then the data from the oldest 30 fragments would be combined into a single fragment and would be further compacted with new data as new values are observed.\n- Time compaction: These sets would be compacted after a configurable time threshold.  If time compaction is enabled to compact a set after 14 days, then the data from fragments older than 14 days would be compacted into a single fragment.\nUpdatedover 1 year ago",

For example, you can check if campaigns are working as expected by using a “test” persona and seeing how the user profile data gets updated.\nAs you get deeper into building campaigns, the user profile provides insight into how your marketing influences user behaviors. For example, if you run a mobile campaign, you can drill down to see if customers are engaging on mobile devices, what days and times they are most active, and what types of content they are affinity for. User profiles are updated in real-time, but there can be a delay while the data is being processed and scores are being calculated for behavior and content affinity.\nTo provide quick access to customer data, the user profile is divided into three tabs:Intelligence,Audiences, andDetails.",

As time passes, an audience that once targeted 500 users may grow to target 10,000. This is great if your audience is targeting engaged users who have shown interest in your upcoming product, but not so great if your audience targets users with outstanding support tickets. Lytics makes it easy to find these insights so your campaign strategies can be adjusted accordingly.\nAudiences can be used in Lytics Experiences, third-party ad campaigns, and tools like Google BigQuery for advanced reporting.

For instance, the number of times a visitor has been to a website or the number of times a subscriber has opened an email. Exact values can be matched, but more commonly, inequalities are expressed.\nExamples:\n- Total Number of Visits must equal 5:Any user who has visited 4 times, 6 times, or any number of times other than 5 will not be matched by this rule.\n- Total Number of Visits must be less than 3:Any user who has visited 0, 1, or 2 times will be matched by this rule.\nText User fields are commonly used for words and miscellaneous information. For instance, a user’s first name. Since there is no mathematical relationship between two text values, the operations used are generally exact match or partial match.\nThere are 5 operator options when making audiences with text user fields:\n- Equal: The value for the field you want the audience to have. Format and character spacing for the value must match exactly what is in the data stream. You can select the value by interacting with the visualization or be promoted with available values by typing into the search bar.\n- Contain: The text entered (case sensitive and exact order) appears within a value for the field.\n- Be Like: Use the wildcard character*along with text to decide the parts of values you want to match. E.g.,testwill only match on the exact string test, whiletest*will match strings starting with test, such as \"testing\", and*test*will match any string that has test in it, such as \"my test case\".",

You can remove values from the list using the “x” to the left of the value. The logic for each of these rules follows the logic from “Equal”.\n- Exist: Excludes everyone that does not have a value for the field.\nExamples\n- First Name must equal Ash:Only users named Ash will be matched.\n- First name must contain Ash:Any user named Ash will be matched. Additionally, anyone named Ashley, Ashton, or any other name that has the letters \"Ash\" next to each other will be matched. Dash or Natasha will NOT be matched - as these do not have an “A.” To make an audience that includes these, create a second rule set for “First name must contain ash.”\nDate user fields are commonly used for any data that represents a point in time. For instance, the last time a user visited a website. Most commonly, a date is chosen to divide the people who fall before or after that date. You will need to select both your starting point and a directionin timefor your custom rule.\nYour starting point could be a fixed point in time (useful for milestone events, like product launches) or a relative point in time (useful for scheduled follow ups).\nSince each rule only handles going forward or backward from a single point in time, you may need to create two rules that work together to bound a range of time. One rule will capture all dates after the first point in time, and a second rule will capture all dates before a later point in time.\nSome date fields have a natural boundary, such as Last Visits, which will never include a date in the future. If you want all Last Visits from a point in time up until now, you would only need to create one rule.\nExamples\n- Last Visit must be Before June 22, 2016:Created by selectingSpecific Dateand the directionBefore. This rule includes only users who have not visited since the 22nd of June.\n- Last Visit must be After 3 days in the past:Created by selectingRelative Date, entering 3 daysIn the pastand selecting the directionAfter. This rule includes only users who have visited in the last three days.\n- Subscription End Date must be within the next 30 days:Created by building two rules: one to set the start date to always be the current date and the other to set the end date to 30 days in the future relative to the current date.Create the first rule by selectingRelative Date,After, entering0 Days, selectingIn the past, and clickingAdd Condition.Create the second rule by selectingRelative Date,Before,30 Days,In the future, and clickingAdd Condition.This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date.\n- Create the first rule by selectingRelative Date,After, entering0 Days, selectingIn the past, and clickingAdd Condition.\n- Create the second rule by selectingRelative Date,Before,30 Days,In the future, and clickingAdd Condition.\n- This audience will now include all users who have a subscription ending in the next 30 days beginning with the current date.\nSet user fields are commonly used for collecting related data over time. For instance, all the URLs a user has visited. These fields are generally used much like text user fields, even though the data is structured differently.\nExamples\n- All URL Paths Ever must contain one of/blog,/products, or/about:Any user who has visited any one of these three paths will be matched.",

This is true whether they only follow Baseball or follow Baseball in addition to Football, Hockey, and Bowling.\nMap user fields are used to add hierarchy to a dynamic domain of data. For instance,Events By Deviceis a count of all events, but grouped by each device. So instead of building a rule by only specifying the count, the rule is built by first specifying the device, then the count.

Upon creation the audience contains 120,000 users. You then run a marketing campaign promoting your international news section. After one week, the audience has grown from 120,000 to 400,000 users with most of the growth occurring in the 24 hours after the campaign was launched.

The core idea behind Insights is simple. Insights are a combination of facts and actions:\n- Fact: Observable, data-driven information providing demonstrable value. This is a unique set of raw metrics, such as the number of users or the amount of lift.\n- Action: Suggested behavior based on user role, data source, activation channels, industry, etc. This is the contextualization of a fact into something to be done.\nInsights are made possible thanks to the data science capabilities built into Lytics. The heavy lift of processing and interpreting data is automatically handled by machine learning models under-the-hood.\nThis is a prime example of how machine learning can augment (not replace) a marketer’s role. Machines efficiently and accurately sift through lots of data, allowing people to then make use of the important information in the most relevant context. For example, a model can predict which users are most likely to churn, and a marketer can then target those at-risk users with a win-back campaign on Facebook.",
