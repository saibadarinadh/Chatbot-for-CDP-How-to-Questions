Otherwise, from your mParticle account, navigate toAudiencesin the left-hand navigation and select eitherReal-timeorStandard.\n- From the list of audiences, find the one you want to forward to Facebook and click the \u00e2\u0080\u009cplus sign\u00e2\u0080\u009d+button under Connected Outputs.\n- ClickConnect Output.\n- SelectFacebook, and use the Configuration Name dropdown menu to select the new configuration you want to send your audience to. ClickNext.\n- Toggle theConnection Statusto eitherInactiveorActive. Only active connections will forward audiences. After completing the setup process, it may take up to 24 hours for your audience data to fully populate in Facebook.\n- Enter your Facebook Application ID. This is only required if you intend to forward Facebook IDs in the next step.\n- Check the box next to each of the following user identities you want to forward to Facebook with your audience:Email address (hashed as SHA256)Phone number (hashed as SHA256)Facebook IDApple IDFAGoogle GAID\nCheck the box next to each of the following user identities you want to forward to Facebook with your audience:\n- Email address (hashed as SHA256)\n- Phone number (hashed as SHA256)\n- Facebook ID\n- Apple IDFA\n- Google GAID\nEmail addresses and Facebook IDs result in higher match rates with Facebook users because they are more unique across the Facebook platform, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommended to use these identities whenever they are available.\n- CheckEnable Multi-Key Audienceto have an additional audience forwarded to Facebook that includes all of the user identities you selected in the previous step.mParticle creates a new custom audience in your Facebook Ads Manager for each identity that you select. For example, if you select both phone and email, you will see two new custom audiences added: one using user phone numbers and one using their email addresses. If you enableMulti-Key Audiences, you will still see a separate audience for each identity, but you will also see an additional audience that includes all of the identities you selected.\nCheckEnable Multi-Key Audienceto have an additional audience forwarded to Facebook that includes all of the user identities you selected in the previous step.\n- mParticle creates a new custom audience in your Facebook Ads Manager for each identity that you select.

From the details panel, click theActionsdropdown menu. Certain actions may be unavailable due to missing payment info or a compliance requirement that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been configured yet for your Ads account.\n\n## Deleting an audience\nmParticle deletes the downstream audience when you delete an audience from mParticle.\n\n## Supported identities\nFollowing are the user identities and device identities that can be forwarded to Facebook. Identities that are hashed asSHA256are noted.\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n- Facebook ID\n- Email address (SHA256)\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n- Phone number (SHA256)\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n- Apple IDFA (SHA256)\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n- Google Advertising ID (SHA256)\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n- Android Device ID (SHA256)\n\n```\nSHA256\n```\n\n## Understanding your match rate\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cmatch rate\u00e2\u0080\u009d for a Facebook audience refers to the percentage of your forwarded user data that Facebook successfully matches to active Facebook users.\nWhen you connect an mParticle audience with Facebook, several user identifiers are included for each audience member (such as email addresses, phone numbers, Facebook user IDs, or mobile advertiser IDs). After you send an audience from mParticle to Facebook, Facebook attempts to match these identifiers to user profiles on Facebook. The match rate indicates how successful Facebook is in finding corresponding user profiles for the identifiers you provided.\nThere are several factors that can impact your match rate:\n- Data quality: more accurate, up-to-date, and complete user data leads to a higher match rate.\n- Privacy settings: Facebook users with stricter privacy or data sharing settings may also impact your match rate.\n- Identifiers used: certain identifiers, like email addresses and Facebook user IDs, have higher match rates due to their uniqueness.\n- Audience size: larger audiences have higher match rates because of the increased chance in finding matches within the set of Facebook users. Facebook suggests a minimum audience size of 1,000 people for best results.\nA higher match rate means that more of your user data was successfully matched to Facebook users, allowing you to reach a larger audience with your ads or other marketing efforts. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep in mind that not all of your user data may match with Facebook users, and the match rate may vary from one audience to another.\n\n## Value-based audiences\nYou can use the mParticle audiences integration to create value-based lookalike audiences. These audiences target users who share similar characteristics and behaviors with your existing high-value customers.\nHowever, unlike traditional lookalike audiences, which are based solely on demographic or interest similarities, value-based lookalike audiences are generated using an attribute that reflects the monetary value or profitability of your customers. For example, if you select a lifetime value attribute, Facebook will create a lookalike audience composed of users that have a higher lifetime value.\nBy default, mParticle only forwards users in a value-based audience to Facebook if the value of their \u00e2\u0080\u009cvalue reprepresenting attribute\u00e2\u0080\u009d is greater than 0. You can include values equaling zero by checkingAllow Zero Valueswhen creating your value-based audience.\nYou can learn more about value-based lookalike audiences inFacebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documentation.\n\n## Customer File Source Requirements\nAs of July 2, 2018, Facebook requires that all new audiences disclose whether their data was collected from customers directly, collected from partners, or both. You can provide this information in the connection settings when connecting an audience to Facebook via the Customer File Source setting.\nYou can learn more about the Customer File Source Requirement inFacebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documentation.\n\n## Data forwarding\n\n## Limits\nFacebook does not allow more than500 custom audiencesto be created per Facebook Ads account. If you attempt to forward more than 500 audiences to Facebook, an error will be returned.\n\n## Upload frequency\nThe Facebook Audience integration uses bulk forwarding. This means that instead of forwarding audience data in real time, mParticle adds updates to a queue. By default, mParticle forwards data to Facebook from this queue whenever one of the following conditions is met:\n- 3 hours have passed since the last update\n- At least 75,000 messages are in the queue\n\n## Verify and troubleshoot your connection\nBefore activating your new connection, or when troubleshooting issues, please be aware of the following:\n\n## Are you forwarding audience data to the correct Facebook Ads account?\nDuring steps 4-5 of the first stage of the setup process, you connect your Facebook account to mParticle. Make sure that you use a Facebook account that has been granted access to the Facebook Ads account you will forward your audiences to, and make sure that after connecting your Facebook account that you use theFacebook Account IDdropdown menu to select the Facebook Ads account.\nIt is possible to have access to multiple Ads accounts, so make sure that you selected the correct Ads account when creating your output.\nReadAccess to a Facebook Ads accountfor instructions on how to make sure your Facebook account has the correct access. If you do not have the correct access, reach out to your Facebook Ads account administrator.\n\n## If you are forwarding Facebook IDs, did you add the correct Facebook app ID?\nIf you are trying to forward Facebook IDs from mParticle to Facebook, you must provide your Facebook application ID.\nOften referred to as an app ID, a Facebook Application ID is a unique ID assigned to your application when you register it on the Facebook Developers platform. This App ID is required to integrate your application with various Facebook functions, such as logging in through Facebook, accessing Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Graph API, or incorporating social plugins like the Like button.\nSeeAccess to your Facebook Application IDfor instructions on how to find your application ID.\n\n## Data latency\nWhile you may see your forwarded mParticle audiences listed in Facebook Ads right away, it can take up to 24 hours before your audience data begins to fully populate. This time can vary depending on how large your audiences are.\n\n## When looking for your audience data in Facebook, select the correct Business Portfolio\nAfter logging into Facebook Ads Manager, make sure that you select the correct Business Portfolio from the left-hand navbar. You should select the Business Portfolio containing the Ads Account you chose to forward your audiences to.\n\n## Forwarding multi-key audiences to Facebook creates multiple audiences\nWhen you select more than one user identity to forward to Facebook, a separate audience will be created in Facebook for each identity you select. If you want to have a single audience containing all of the identities you selected, make sure that you checkEnable Multi-Key Audienceswhen connecting your audience to Facebook.\nHowever, even with multi-key audiences enabled, you will still see an additional audience in Facebook for each identity selected.\n\n## Settings reference\n\n## Configuration Settings\n\n```\nstring\n```\n\n```\nstring\n```\n\n## Connection Settings\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nstring\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nstring\n```\n\n```\nbool\n```\n\n```\nenum\n```\n\n```\nenum\n```\n\n```\nenum\n```",
