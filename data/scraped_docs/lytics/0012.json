If you don't currently have access via the product switcher at the top of the primary navigation, contact support or your account management team.\n\n## Common Use-cases\nCloud Connect unlocks many use cases enabling marketers to segment their customers based on any attributes stored in their database. A few examples include:\n- Time Window: All users who did not log in last month.\n- Joins (B2B): All users associated with accounts without feature \"x.\"\n- Lifetime Value (LTV) or Rollup: All users with a premium subscription have purchased at least two products.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd8Need a warehouse?\nNeed a warehouse?\nDon't currently have access to a data warehouse? Lytics has you covered with Lytics Warehouse. We provide a simple data warehouse on top of Google BigQuery to all of our customers as part of Conductor. Simply reach out to account manager or support for access and information.\n\n## How it Works\nCloud Connect augments the rest of the Lytics CDP suite by providing a secure and flexible entry point into your data warehouse. Users can quickly write a standard SQL query to perform a number of complex data manipulations or aggregations and stream the results directly to materialized user profiles. From there, generate insight-heavy reports, enrich targeted segments, and activate across hundreds of marketing channels in just a few clicks.\nBelow you'll find an overview of the general architecture, which can be summarized into these key value drivers:\n- Direct access to existing customer data in your warehouse.\n- No need to rip and replace or replicate consumer data in order to activate.\n- Leverage standard SQL to extract only what is relevant to your business goals.\n- Maintain your warehouse as the \"source of truth.\"\n- Requires very little to implement and begin generating ROI.\nUpdatedover 1 year ago",
