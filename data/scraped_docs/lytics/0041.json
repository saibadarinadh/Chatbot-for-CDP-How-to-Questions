  "content": "Lytics offers a wide range of pre-packaged user attributes, including automatically generated and customizable ones. Additionally, Lytics employs predictive modeling and machine learning algorithms to provide insights and scores, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of their audience. The guide below provides an overview of all available attributes and examples to enhance your profiling efforts.\n\n## \ud83d\udc4d\nIf you haven't already reviewed ourdocumentation on collecting eventsvia our JavaScript SDK, we highly recommend doing so first. This will give you a better understanding of how data collection works at a high level before delving into the specifics of what can be collected.\n\n## Available Attributes\nThe following attributes are all available out of the box with no customization necessary in all Lytics pricing tiers. Do note that any attributes flagged asComputedcan not be edited directly but are computed based on various factors, including other non-computed attributes.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd8\nFor a more comprehensive example of how any of the following attributes can be collected and used for your visitors click thenameof the identifier to access the code examples below.\n\n## Identifiers\nDefault attributes that are used to stitch profiles together. For instance, if you pass anemailalong with the_uid, all events that have only been associated with either identifier will be merged into a single comprehensive profile.\n\n```\n_id\n```\n\n```\n_uid\n```\n\n```\n_uids\n```\n\n```\nemail\n```\n\n```\n[email\u00a0protected]\n```\n\n```\nuuid\n```\n\n## Details\nDetails encompass all default attributes related to user demographics and general information, including name, phone number, status, etc. It serves as a catch-all for attributes not specifically tied to interactions or behaviors.\n\n```\nname\n```\n\n```\nfirst_name\n```\n\n```\nlast_name\n```\n\n```\ntitle\n```\n\n```\nphone\n```\n\n```\ncell\n```\n\n```\norigin\n```\n\n```\nlanguage\n```\n\n```\nage\n```\n\n```\ncompanies\n```\n\n```\ngender\n```\n\n```\nstatus\n```\n\n```\nuser_attributes\n```\n\n```\ntimezone\n```\n\n```\ncity\n```\n\n```\ncountry\n```\n\n```\nstate\n```\n\n## Meta\nMeta encompasses all system-level information that provides insights into the health and breadth of the profile. This includes data such as creation date, last update timestamp, source information, and other metadata associated with the profile's management and maintenance. Metadata offers a behind-the-scenes view of the profile's overall status and administration.\n\n```\n_created\n```\n\n```\n_last_scored\n```\n\n```\n_modified\n```\n\n```\n_num_aliases\n```\n\n```\n_num_days\n```\n\n```\n_num_events\n```\n\n```\n_num_streams\n```\n\n```\n_streamnames\n```\n\n```\nis_bot\n```\n\n## Behavior\nBehavioral attributes typically cannot be directly managed but represent a set of insights derived from a user's behavior over time. These insights are invaluable when personalizing experiences based on changes in behavior or behaviors indicative of high likelihood. For instance, you might want to present a premium offer to users exhibiting higher momentum than usual. Behavioral attributes enable targeted and timely interventions tailored to user actions and patterns.\n\n```\nscore_consistency\n```\n\n```\nscore_frequency\n```\n\n```\nscore_intensity\n```\n\n```\nscore_maturity\n```\n\n```\nscore_momentum\n```\n\n```\nscore_propensity\n```\n\n```\nscore_quantity\n```\n\n```\nscore_recency\n```\n\n```\nscore_volatility\n```\n\n## Interests\nInterests entail understanding the topics a user is interested in based on their interactions, cross-referenced by deep programmatic analysis of their online activities. This allows for tailored content recommendations and targeted messaging aligned with the user's preferences and engagement history.\n\n```\nlytics_content\n```\n\n## Intelligence\nAttributes classified as intelligence encompass diverse, highly valuable information to facilitate relevant and high-value personalized experiences. Within this category, you'll discover real-time segment membership, values crucial for split testing and experimentation, and direct correlation to our real-time machine learning modeling. These attributes empower dynamic and data-driven decision-making, enhancing the efficacy of personalized marketing strategies.\n\n```\n_segments\n```\n\n```\n_split\n```\n\n```\n_split2\n```\n\n```\nneeds_message\n```\n\n```\nnext_event\n```\n\n```\nsegment_prediction\n```\n\n```\nsegment_prediction_percentile\n```\n\n## Activity\nActivity encompasses the user's engagement across different channels and campaigns, including clicks and conversions. It provides valuable insights into recent interactions, aiding campaign optimization and channel effectiveness assessment.\n\n## General\n\n```\nevent_first_seen\n```\n\n```\nevent_last_seen\n```\n\n```\nchannels\n```\n\n```\ndevices\n```\n\n```\nhourly\n```\n\n```\nhourofweek\n```\n\n```\nlast_active_ts\n```\n\n```\nlast_channel_activities\n```\n\n## Web\n\n```\ndomains\n```\n\n```\nfirstvisit_ts\n```\n\n```\nlastvisit_ts\n```\n\n```\npageviewct\n```\n\n```\nrefdomain\n```\n\n```\nuser_agent\n```\n\n```\nvisitct\n```\n\n```\nvisit_city\n```\n\n```\nvisit_country\n```\n\n```\nvisit_region\n```\n\n```\nform_data\n```\n\n```\nforms_submitted\n```\n\n```\nutm_campaign_last\n```\n\n```\nutm_campaigns\n```\n\n```\nutm_content_last\n```\n\n```\nutm_contents\n```\n\n```\nutm_medium_last\n```\n\n```\nutm_mediums\n```\n\n```\nutm_source_last\n```\n\n```\nutm_sources\n```\n\n```\nutm_term_last\n```\n\n```\nutm_terms\n```\n\n## Campaign\n\n```\nly_hover\n```\n\n```\nly_impressions\n```\n\n```\nly_closes\n```\n\n```\nly_conversions\n```\n\n```\nly_milestones\n```\n\n```\nly_goals\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n## Identifiers\n\n## Lytics ID (_id)\n\n```\n_id\n```\nThis is an automatically generated canonical ID managed by Lytics.
