It describes any arbitrary event that the user has triggered. For some industry verticals and applications, Segment has standardized event names. For Ecommerce tracking, for example, there arespecific event names and propertiesthat we recognize semantically. This semantic meaning allows Segment to specially recognize and transform key events before sending them off to each different tool.\nThere are a few places where Segment has standardized event names and properties already:\n- Mobile\n- A/B Testing\n- Ecommerce\n- Email\n- Live Chat\n- Video\nIn the future Segment plans to standardize event names from other data sources as well.\nThis page was last modified: 21 Nov 2023\n\n## Need support?\nQuestions?
